	<p>Bella Purdy is a Master in City Planning candidate in the Department of Urban Studies and Planning at MIT. Within DUSP, she associates with the City, Design, and Development and Housing, Community, and Economic Development groups. Her research is centered around issues of forced displacement and resettlement due to rising sea levels in major American coastal cities. Bella hopes to examine new housing typologies that support affordability and densification in resettlement scenarios. She is currently researching post-disaster land acquisition policies for the Urban Risk Lab at MIT. The Urban Risk Lab is proposing new post-disaster housing models to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. In addition, she is the outreach and recruitment coordinator for the MIT RCT, 'MBTA reduced transit fares study' which examines the effect of transit fare on the ability for low income populations to access services and destinations that promote their health and well being. Before coming to MIT, Bella worked for three years in Philadelphia at the architecture and design research firm, KieranTimberlake. Bella holds a Bachelor of Science in Architecture and Global Sustainability from the University of Virginia.</p>
